# Helicon Node Sample App
This repository contains the files required to run the Helicon Node Quickstart.

Helicon is a simple, scalable, robust, code-free and generic platform to enable and productise the next generation of "online modified", real-time event stream ML/AI models.

## Set up the project

This project uses a Helicon library, so you need to properly configure the `settings.xml` file located at `USER_HOME/.m2/`. Please, [contact us](mailto:support@radicalbit.io) to gain access to the library.

After that, you have to run `mvn clean install` to install the project and resolve the dependencies.
